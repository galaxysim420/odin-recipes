        <h3>Description</h3>
        A traditional French-style lemon tart with creamy, dreamy, lemon curd filling, that tastes just like the ones in Paris. It's my mom's recipe and has been a favorite in my family for years.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h5>Crust</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>fully baked tart crust</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Lemon Curd Filling</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large eggs plus 2 egg yolks (or 3 whole eggs)</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 table spoon lemon zest</li>
                <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium heatproof bowl, place eggs, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, and heavy cream, if using, and whisk to combine. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (brain-marie). Cook on moderate heat, whisking constantly, until mixture becomes thick.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and immediately strain mixture through a sieve. Add butter, a few cubes at a time, and whisk until completely melted and incorporated, and mixture is smooth. Take your time with it</li>
                <li>Fill the tart shell with lemon curd, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours until chilled. Serve with berries and whipped cream if you like.</li>
            </ol>
